                <h1>My Background</h1>
                <strong><small>Out of high school I went to college to be nurse. Everyone I spoke to said the medical field was a good career choice. Spent 2 years studying to be a nurse and then I decided it wasn’t the right career path for me to follow I then changed directions and studied business management. For the last 8 years I have been working as restaurateur with Chipotle. </p>

                <h1>Why I want to be Web Developer</h1>
                <strong><small>I have gotten burnt out working in a fast-food restaurant. I was working 80 hour weeks with no time to spend with my family. I have multiple friends that I have grown up with that have created a career for them self’s as computer science majors and software engineers. After conversations with them as well as doing some research I found coding temple. Spoke to my wife and we both agreed I need to  make the change. So here I am fully committed to learning how to code for the next 10 weeks and beyond and creating a career as a software engineer.</p>
